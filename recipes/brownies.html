        <h1>Quick brownies recipe !</h1>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          This easy brownies recipe requires just 1 bowl, no mixer, and takes
          less than an hour to make! These from scratch brownies are tall,
          fudgy, and chewy with that thin shiny crust on top and tons of
          chocolate flavor.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and HOT</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil, (olive oil or coconut oil are fine)</li>
          <li>
            1 1/8 cup superfine sugar, (caster sugar or white granulated sugar)*
          </li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1/2 cup all purpose (or plain) flour</li>
          <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
          <li>
            Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking oil spray.
            Line with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine hot melted butter, oil and sugar together in a medium-sized
            bowl. Whisk well for about a minute. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat
            until lighter in color (another minute).
          </li>
          <li>
            Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry
            ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT
            over beat as doing so well affect the texture of your brownies).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly.
            (OPTIONAL: Top with chocolate chunks or chocolate chips.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies in the
            pan no longer jiggles and is just set to the touch (the brownies
            will keep baking in the hot pan out of the oven). If testing with a
            toothpick, the toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured
            brownies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into 16
            brownies.
          </li>
          <h4>Additional Add Ins</h4>
          <li>
            Crushed walnuts, peanuts, almonds, pecans, chocolate chips, peanut
            butter chips, chocolate chunks, dried fruit (cranberries, raisins,
            etc)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>NOTES</h4>
        <p>
          *Regular white, granulated, sugar can be used if you can't find caster
          sugar. For even fudgier brownies, use half white and half light brown
          sugar!
